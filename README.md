# Hydra-Net-model

This repository contains various network models aiming to represent the basice excitability properties of Hydra vulgaris neural net. It 
describes simple integrate-and-fire network with the nearest neighbor connectivity. Here we considered AMPA, and GAP-junctional coupling.

This is mostly the ongoing work.
